			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>I started with some whatever base code I could find on the Google Charts website. https://developers.google.com/chart this site in particular if anyone cares. I just changed some numbers around and the words of stuff. Added some new categories to the charts and etc. I did not understand anything about how to code in this.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>I tried using a new chart type and then getting data for what I was going to show. I basically just thought about what data I was going to use and put it in.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>At this point I tried do a lot of fucking changes with what the reference said I could do. The problem was everything I did either caused the html to stop working or did nothing at all. I spent hours trying to figure it out and came to the conclusion that I'm stupid. Stupid and on a time crunch. So I was unable to spend the whole day figuring out a library. So I said I gotta give up and do some other work.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section"> 
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I did all the work. The work is disappointing, but I simply lack the time to learn this whole fucking library. I'm still so confused as to what exactly this experiment is. Like we do 6 experiments on p5.js and then surprise use these brand new libraries to make an experiment. What the fuck man. Anyways the highs were the beginning with naive me hoping things go smoothly. The lows was the part where I went insane screaming and punching.</p>
